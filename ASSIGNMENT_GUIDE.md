# 🎯 Student Assignment System - Complete Implementation

## Overview
Your assignment system is **fully functional** and ready to use! This guide shows you exactly how everything works together.

## ✅ What's Already Working

### Backend (Node.js/Express)
- ✅ **Authentication**: JWT-based with Student role verification
- ✅ **API Routes**: GET assignments, POST submissions with file upload
- ✅ **Database Models**: Assignment and Submission schemas
- ✅ **File Upload**: Supports PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, JPG, PNG (up to 10MB)
- ✅ **Middleware**: Auth, role permissions, and file upload handling

### Frontend (React)
- ✅ **Assignments Page**: Beautiful Material-UI interface
- ✅ **Status Tracking**: Pending, Submitted, Graded tabs
- ✅ **File Upload**: Drag-and-drop with validation
- ✅ **Real-time Updates**: React Query for efficient data fetching
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive user feedback

## 🔧 Quick Test

### 1. Start the System
```bash
# Backend
cd backend && npm start

# Frontend (in new terminal)
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

### 2. Login as Student
- Navigate to student login
- Use your student credentials (rollNumber + password)

### 3. View Assignments
- Go to Assignments page
- You'll see assignments organized by status
- Statistics cards show pending/submitted/graded counts

### 4. Submit an Assignment
- Click "Submit" on any pending assignment
- Add text content or upload a file (or both)
- Click Submit - it will update in real-time!

## 📊 Key API Endpoints

```http
# Get all assignments for logged-in student
GET /api/students/assignments
Authorization: Bearer <student_token>

# Submit assignment with file upload
POST /api/students/assignments/{id}/submit
Authorization: Bearer <student_token>
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Body: { content: "text", file: <file> }

# Get assignment details
GET /api/students/assignments/{id}
Authorization: Bearer <student_token>
```

## 🎨 UI Features

### Assignment Cards
- **Color-coded status**: Red (pending), Blue (submitted), Green (graded)
- **Due date warnings**: Shows days remaining or "Overdue"
- **Grade display**: With star ratings when graded
- **Action buttons**: Submit, View Details

### Submission Interface
- **Dual input**: Text content AND file upload
- **File validation**: Type and size checking
- **Progress indicators**: Loading states during submission
- **Error handling**: User-friendly error messages

## 🔐 Security & Validation

### Authentication Flow
1. Student logs in with rollNumber/password
2. Backend returns JWT token with Student role
3. All assignment endpoints verify token and role
4. Students can only see assignments for their class/section

### File Upload Security
- **Type restrictions**: Only safe file types allowed
- **Size limits**: 10MB maximum
- **Unique naming**: Prevents file conflicts
- **Secure storage**: Files stored in protected directory

## 📈 Data Flow

1. **Student Login** → JWT token stored in localStorage
2. **Load Assignments** → GET /api/students/assignments
3. **Display Status** → Categorize by submission status
4. **Submit Assignment** → POST with FormData (text + file)
5. **Update UI** → React Query invalidates cache and refetches

## 🎯 Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: View Assignments
- Login as student
- Navigate to Assignments page
- Verify assignments load correctly
- Check status tabs work properly

### Scenario 2: Submit Text Assignment
- Click Submit on pending assignment
- Enter text content
- Submit successfully
- Verify status changes to "Submitted"

### Scenario 3: Submit File Assignment
- Click Submit on pending assignment
- Upload a PDF/DOC file
- Verify file size/type validation
- Submit successfully

### Scenario 4: Submit Both Text + File
- Add both text content and file
- Submit successfully
- Verify both are saved

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**"No assignments found"**
- Ensure you have assignments created for the student's class
- Check if assignments are in "Active" status
- Verify student's class/section matches assignment

**"Authentication failed"**
- Check JWT token is valid
- Verify student role is set correctly
- Ensure Authorization header format: `Bearer <token>`

**"File upload failed"**
- Check file size (must be < 10MB)
- Verify file type is supported
- Ensure uploads directory exists

**"Assignment not loading"**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify backend server is running
- Check database connection
